<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Network Packet Broker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inline Network Packet Broker</li><li>Non-inline Network Packet Broker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The network packet broker (NPB) market comprises two main types: inline and non-inline. Inline network packet brokers operate directly within the data path, allowing for real-time packet filtering and manipulation, enhancing security and performance. Conversely, non-inline network packet brokers function out of the data path, capturing traffic for analysis without affecting data flow, making them suitable for passive monitoring. Both types serve to improve network visibility, performance, and security by optimizing how data packets are managed and analyzed.</p></p>
